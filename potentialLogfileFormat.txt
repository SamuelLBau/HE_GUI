If think that if the logfile I was reading from was presented like this,
parts of my job would be easier. I already have a parser working, but if
data was presented like this I expect I would be better able to use Numpy
to find / sort / interpret data

row 1:  Column tags, string literals
row 2:  Data type of each column, string literals

--Since we are taking more thermal images more frequently, I intend to use them as the line ID

--The delimeter may need to be a pipe, if any entries are strings that include commas

--I will need each column tag to be unique, though this should already be case received data

--tabs not necessary in saved version

--since you want a data snapshot for both thermal and visible images,
    it would be nice if you could have a separate file for visible snapshots and thermal snapshots

thermal-image: Either image ID or full image name, imageName may be better if suffix/extension might change
visible-image: Either image ID or full image name, imageName may be better if suffix/extension might change

if you go with imageID, maybe add tags like this above the sample

thermal-suffix: _IR.png
visible-suffix: _VIS.png

example log file:


thermal-image               ,visible-image                      ,latitude   ,longitude  ,etc.  ,etc.
string                      ,string                             ,float      ,float      ,etc.  ,etc.
